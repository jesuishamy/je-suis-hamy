                    This event, which occurs every summer, takes place in Colmar's Europe-Schweitzer priority district. The aim is to go and meet with children (many of 
                    whom don't go on vacation) where they live and organize a variety of workshops over the course of a weekend. On the program: reading, kamishibai, The 
                    Werewolves of Miller‚Äôs Hollow, soccer matches, poems, drawing and hand puppets. As for me, I was in charge of the singing and body percussion 
                    workshop... But I was also spoiled: the children styled my hair, gave me hugs and even generously shared their snacks (and even secrets ü§´) with me! 
                    What an honor for me to have been accepted as one of their friends during these moments spent together!

                <p><b>- ATD Fourth World - Youth Camp in Colmar, July 2024 </b> <br><br>
                    The ATD Fourth World House is home to various activities organized by the association. Generally speaking, it welcomes everyone: it's a house, but 
                    also mine and anyone else's who might find the comforts of a home here. For a week, with a small group of young participants, we mobilized to give it 
                    a makeover: staining, painting the walls, clearing and mowing the lawn, destroying the kitchen to renovate it completely, assembling new furniture, 
                    tidying up... In short, a week during which I had the opportunity to form a team with people I'd just met to build a beautiful home, not only for us, 
                    but also for others...

                    ‚ÄúPlaying together to live together‚Äù<br>
                    It's said that music brings people together, and that's exactly what the Ballade association is doing: reaching out to the most excluded populations 
                    in society (gypsies, prisoners, the unemployed, residents and children of disadvantaged neighborhoods...) to make the practice of music accessible to
                     them. But music is just an excuse, because the real objective is to be able to talk to them, listen to them, be there for them and, ultimately, help 
                     them to reintegrate. Ballade also has an international dimension, as it regularly takes part in and organizes exchanges that enable participants to 
                     focus on their identity as musicians and forget about any conflicts that may exist between different countries. I was very happy to be able to 
                     contribute to the association in my own way. I've been able to attend concerts, workshops and even a week-long erasmus+ exchange in Germany! All these 
                     experiences have motivated me even more to work in the associative sector!

                    Working for inclusion is no mean feat! But it's a challenge that the FACE foundation takes up through its action in various areas: employment and 
                    integration, education and career guidance, energy, housing and digital... My experience with this association has enabled me to help and exchange 
                    with people I would otherwise never have met. It also enabled me to develop the life skills that have stayed with me to this day, and that will help 
                    me in my future missions in contact with other people, who are different but similar to me...

                    The International Movement for Child Relief (Mouvement International d‚ÄôAide √† l‚ÄôEnfance) brings together some fifteen associations fighting child 
                    malnutrition in 8 different countries: Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Haiti, Honduras, Madagascar, Mexico and Peru. This alliance enables its members to 
                    support each other both morally and financially, in order to better manage the various canteens and nutritional centers... and even to build new ones! 
                    This first experience working alongside humanitarian associations enabled me to familiarize myself with the associative environment and pushed me out 
                    of my comfort zone: leading a team! It was a challenging experience, but one from which I emerged stronger, with new strings to my bow!

                <p>
                    FPMA is a religious and cultural association whose youth section is a playground for me, as it enables me to experiment, develop my skills and assert 
                    my personality in a caring environment in which I feel at ease. As a result, I've been able to take on diverse positions:

                <p>
                    The missions of the people who are responsible for FPMA's youth section are diverse: organizing events (concerts, musicals, meals, tray sales, 
                    meetings...), Bible studies and other activities to ensure the spiritual fulfillment of its members.
